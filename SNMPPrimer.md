Before getting started with Agentuino it is recommended to familiarize yourself with Simple Network Management Protocol.

To understand the low level structure of an SNMP packet, read up on [ASN.1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One) and the [BER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Encoding_Rules) encoding of ASN.1 .  [Section 8 of RFC1906](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1906#section-8), which places a few additional SNMP specific constraints on BER encoding, will also be of interest
